## Exercise 1

Open the program called *multilingual_greeter.py*

* For each function, remove the line containing the pass statement and implement the functionality described in the docstrings.
* Run the unit tests to validate that the implementation passes unit tests.

```
python3 -m unittest test_multilingual_greeter.py
```

Once all tests are passing, you should be able to run the program.
